<div  align=justify>BWChart is a tool to manage and analyse replays from the game Starcraft Broodwar(tm). It comes as a simple executable 
with no installer / uninstaller. BWChart data files are saved in the \My Documents\bwchart folder. It should run on all 
Windows platforms except 95. The main screen is divided in sections (tabs) that are quickly described below.

MANHATTAN lets you organize multiple projects into workspaces. Each workspace can be divided into folders and sub-folders.
 Folders contain projects. You can then build a complete set of projets in one click.

The 3D city view gets you right inside the source code. Every building represents a method of a class. 
The longer the method (in lines of code), the taller the building. The number of parameters for the method
 makes the width of the building. All buildings of a same class have the same color and are located close to
  each other.
<p>The spacing between the streets and the building is proportional to the spacing in your code, that is the ratio 
  between effective lines of code and the rest (comments+empty). The more comments in your code, the greener is the 
  grass around your buildings.
<p>Now, even non-developers can tell the difference between healthy, good-looking, clean code, and spaghetti code.

The score view summarizes all the results of the code analysis: %comments, %asserts, average lines per method, etc. 
The rightmost value on the score view is the weight of each mark into the Overall score displayed at the bottom.
